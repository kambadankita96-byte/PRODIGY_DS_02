# About Project
## What is the main objective of your Titanic project?
The main objective of this project was to perform data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset to understand the factors that affected passenger survival, such as gender, age, passenger class, and fare.
## Which columns in the dataset had missing values and how did you handle them?
The columns Age, Cabin, and Embarked had missing values.
I filled Age using the median value.
I filled Embarked using the mode.
I dropped the Cabin column because it had too many missing values.
## What were the key insights from your EDA?
My EDA showed that:
Females had a much higher survival rate than males.
1st-class passengers survived more compared to 2nd and 3rd class.
Children had better survival chances.
Passengers who paid higher fares were more likely to survive.
## How did you visualize relationships in the data?
I used visualizations such as:
Countplot for survival rate and gender
Histogram for age distribution
Boxplot for fare vs. survival
Correlation heatmap for numeric features
These helped identify important patterns easily.
## Why is the Titanic dataset important for learning Data Science or EDA?
The Titanic dataset is widely used because it is simple, yet provides a good mix of numerical, categorical, missing, and imbalanced data. It helps beginners learn data cleaning, feature understanding, visualization, and basic predictive modeling concepts.
